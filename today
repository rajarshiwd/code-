NgForm Directive

You can export the directive into a local template variable using ngForm as the key (ex: #myForm="ngForm").
This is optional, but useful. Many properties from the underlying FormGroup instance are duplicated on the directive itself, 
so a reference to it will give you access to the aggregate value and validity status of the form, 
as well as user interaction properties like dirty and touched

Registering the Child Controls 

To register child controls with the form, you'll want to use NgModel with a name attribute.
You can also use NgModelGroup if you'd like to create sub-groups within the form.

Track control state and validity with ngModel

Using ngModel in a form gives you more than just two-way data binding. It also tells you if the user touched the control, 
if the value changed, or if the value became invalid.

The NgModel directive doesn't just track state; it updates the control with special Angular CSS classes that reflect the state. 
You can leverage those class names to change the appearance of the control.

State	Class if true	Class if false
The control has been visited.	ng-touched	ng-untouched
The control's value has changed.	ng-dirty	ng-pristine
The control's value is valid.	ng-valid	ng-invalid

ngSubmit

You can listen to the directive's ngSubmit event to be notified when the user has triggered a form submission. 
The ngSubmit event will be emitted with the original form submission event.

ngnoForm 

In template driven forms, all <form> tags are automatically tagged as NgForm. 
If you want to import the FormsModule but skip its usage in some forms, for example, to use native HTML5 validation,
you can add ngNoForm and the <form> tags won't create an NgForm directive. In reactive forms, using ngNoForm is unnecessary because
the <form> tags are inert. In that case, you would refrain from using the formGroup directive
